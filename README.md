# Project Description:

The topic we chose for this project is a money management application. This app allows users to track their expenses in different categories, such as groceries, clothes, foods, exercise, etc. It also lets them get a net amount of their budget and provides them with visualizations of their expenditure distribution by showing a percentage graph. In addition, users have the option to set limits for their whole budget and each of the categories of their choice. They also have the option to log in/out and delete their account.  Users can view the chart of their expenditure in different categories.
